Here is about to introduce a new kind of number system. Where instead of 10 digits there is 20, from a to t, all in small. Now a means 1, b means 2 and t means 20, thenn aa means 21. Now for a new number you have to print the decimal form it.
Note that the letters in the input string will be lower case and from a to t
Input Format:
Single line containing the string of new number system's number
Output Format:
Single line denoting the integer with the same decimal value as the
input string
Sample input 1: e
Sample Output: 5

Code:

def atoz(s):
    i=0
    k=0
    while(i<len(s)):
        k=k*20+(ord(s[i])-ord('a')+1)
        i=i+1
    return k
s=input()
print(atoz(s))
